Ripple Core
=========

![Build Status](http://bamboo.rippleosi.org/plugins/servlet/wittified/build-status/RPLE-IDCRC)

### Requirements

To develop and run the application locally you must have the following installed:
* Java JDK 8
* Maven 3
* NodeJS
* MySQL

### Installation

Create the database locally by running the scripts found in ripple-database/src/main/resources/sql/legacy.
These are to be run in the order specified in the following file:  
sql_script_run_order.info

Install Java Development Kit 8:  
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Install Maven 3:  
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

Ensure that the system environment variables for Java and Maven are set correctly, as described below...

M2_HOME should point to the install directory of your local Maven install folder, e.g.  
```
M2_HOME C:\Maven\apache-maven-3.3.3
```

JAVA_HOME should point to the install directory of your local Java JDK install folder, e.g.  
```
JAVA_HOME C:\Java\jdk1.8.0_65
```

PATH should contain the bin directory of both M2_HOME and JAVA_HOME, e.g.  
```
...;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%M2_HOME%\bin;
```

Ensure that you have a context file located in the root directory of the project. This file contains configuration
which is vital to the application. You can copy the a fully working example of one, which is located here:  
ripple-demonstrator-api\src\main\resources\config\tomcat-context-example.xml

### Running the Application

Open up a shell and navigate to the project root directory. Use the following command to build and start the development
server for the Java API:  
```sh
mvn clean package -Pwebapp:run
```

If you're experiencing build errors, execute the following commands:   
```sh
java -version
```

```sh
mvn -version 
```

If they do not return a suitable response, ensure that your JAVA_HOME and M2_HOME system environment variables are pointing
to the correct install directory, and that the \bin directories within them are on your PATH system environment variable.
